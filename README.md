### **ABOUT THE APP**

*Coach Me* is a fitness app that aims to help people achieve their health and fitness goals through personalized training. Users can book appointments with nearby trainers using geolocation technology or access a library of self-workout plans tailored to their specific objectives. 

The app is designed to make it convenient for users to reach their fitness goals, whether they prefer to work out with a trainer or on their own.

### **TO TEST THE APP**
<br/>

#### **1. SDK Location**
This repository doesn't contain the `local.properties` file where the SDK location resides. Once this app is opened in Android Studio, be sure that it automatically creates this file with the correct SDK location. If not, you can do the following: File -> Project Structure -> Select the SDK Location -> Apply

#### **2. Updating GPS Location in Emulator**
We recommend to set the location of your emulator as per the following image: 

![Test Location](./testuserlocation.png "Test User Location")

#### **3. Allow Location and Notification**
To allow booking appointments based on the geo-location and receive push notifications, we recommend to accept both permissions requests after log-in into the app.
