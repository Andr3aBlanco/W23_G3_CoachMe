### **ABOUT THE APP**

*Coach Me* is a fitness app that aims to help people achieve their health and fitness goals through personalized training. Users can book appointments with nearby trainers using geolocation technology or access a library of self-workout plans tailored to their specific objectives. 

The app is designed to make it convenient for users to reach their fitness goals, whether they prefer to work out with a trainer or on their own.
